<h1>PRESS STATEMENT ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE WORLD'S INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</h1>
    

<body>
    <p>August 9, 2024 - The African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights recognizes the role that the African Union, the United Nations, and civil society organizations have played in advancing and defending the rights of indigenous peoples both within and outside of Africa. The Commission also joins the rest of the world in celebrating the progress made in this regard. Today is International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples.
        Indigenous peoples around the world still struggle to promote and defend their rights as unique peoples, despite the progress that has been accomplished in recent years. Various conditions that continue to make indigenous peoples weaker and less fortunate still exist today. In this context, the Commission is concerned by the numerous instances of forcible evictions against Native Americans and the data showing their restricted access to essential services, such as healthcare and education.</p>
    
        The Department of Basic Education's Education Facilities Management report revealed that 3,932 schools continued to utilize illegal pit latrines, infringing on students' rights to health, dignity, safety, and life, even though pledges had been made to eliminate and replace them by 2023.
        According to a 2030 Reading Panel assessment, 82% of Grade 4 students—up from 78% in the pre-pandemic period—were unable to read any language with meaning. Members of civil society and professionals in education make up the panel, which gathers data on learning and advises the government.
        According to reports, the energy crisis hampered access to education, making it more likely that already entrenched inequities would worsen as a result of children showing up to school hungry and with incomplete assignments, sometimes even late.
